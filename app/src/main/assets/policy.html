    <br/>
    We collect and store personal messages in your inbox.
    <br/>
    We collect messages sent by senders. By analyzing your SMS and various accounts, transaction
    amount and transaction date, we can determine your risk status, and then provide you with
    appropriate credit analysis. This enables you to obtain financial facilities from regulated
    financial entities and other service providers available on the platform. In view of the current
    imperfect online credit system, all your messages are an important basis for our approval. We
    will only collect SMS information with your explicit consent. SMS will be uploaded to <font

    delete the SMS.

    to detect close contacts including name and phone numbers, so that you can automatically
    fill in the data. This can also help us detect credible references. The more credible the
    reference, the lower the risk associated with users. We collect contact information only
    after obtaining your additional explicit consent. Contact information will be uploaded to
    <font color="#DA453F">https://api.quamte.com/</font>. After analyzing your risk situation,
